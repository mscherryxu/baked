# Welcome to Baked by Fullstack!

In this Github repo are the changes I will be making to our group project. This is what we did so far: https://github.com/2206-fsa-gs-team-gemini/baked

As the project was not complete, we agreed to add our own changes we would want by forking it and making changes in our own repo.

## Enjoy the baked goods, including cakes and cookies! Feel free to browse and enjoy the sweets!
